            <h3>Madhubani Painting</h3>

            <p>
                Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, originated in the Mithila
                region of Bihar. Traditionally practiced by women on mud walls, floors,
                and handmade paper, this art form uses natural pigments derived from
                plants, minerals, and charcoal.
            </p>

            <p>
                The paintings are characterized by bold outlines, flat perspective,
                and intricate patterns filling every available space. Common themes
                include Hindu deities, celestial symbols, flora, fauna, and scenes
                from epics like the Ramayana.

            <h3>Warli Painting</h3>

            <p>
                Warli painting is a tribal art form practiced by the Warli community
                of Maharashtra. Unlike colorful folk traditions, Warli art is
                minimalistic, using white pigment on an earthy brown background.
            </p>

            <p>
                Human figures are depicted using simple geometric shapes such as
                circles, triangles, and lines. The paintings often portray village
                life, farming activities, rituals, and dances, emphasizing the
                relationship between humans and nature.

            <p>
                Tanjore paintings originated in Tamil Nadu during the reign of the
                Chola dynasty. These paintings are known for their rich colors,
                surface relief, and extensive use of gold foil.
            </p>

            <p>
                Primarily devotional in nature, Tanjore paintings depict Hindu gods
                and goddesses, with a strong emphasis on symmetry and ornamentation.
                The gold work adds a luminous, three-dimensional quality to the artwork.

            <h3>Pattachitra Painting</h3>

            <p>
                Pattachitra is a traditional painting style from Odisha, created on
                cloth prepared with natural adhesives. The name derives from the
                Sanskrit words “patta” (cloth) and “chitra” (picture).
            </p>

            <p>
                These paintings are narrative in nature and often illustrate stories
                of Lord Jagannath, Krishna, and episodes from Hindu mythology. Strong
                lines, bold colors, and decorative borders are defining features.

            <h3>Kalamkari Painting</h3>

            <p>
                Kalamkari is a hand-painted or block-printed textile art form created
                using a bamboo pen, known as a “kalam.” Natural dyes are used to
                produce deep, earthy tones.
            </p>

            <p>
                The themes of Kalamkari revolve around mythological stories, temple
                scrolls, and epics such as the Mahabharata. The process is highly
                labor-intensive and follows multiple stages of dyeing and washing.

            <p>
                Mughal miniature paintings developed during the Mughal Empire and

            <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>

            <p>
                Indian paintings are not merely aesthetic objects. They serve
                as cultural texts, preserving stories, values, and traditions
                across generations. The artist’s role is that of a storyteller
                and cultural custodian.In India, a painting is rarely just a decoration on a wall; it’s a visual prayer,
                a historical record, and a community’s signature. Indian art is deeply rooted in the philosophy that
                "Chitra" (painting) is a medium to bridge the gap between the human and the divine.
